Estimating when a new software feature will be done is a tricky but important task. “When will you be done?” Typically on the other end of this question is the person writing your check. Maybe not directly, but follow the request up the chain and you will certainly end up eye to eye with the check writer. Another important business fundamental is predictability of the development pipeline. Voice of the customer goes in one end, software features come out the other end. The ability to estimate how long the pipeline will be tied up on a feature is important for scheduling resources and planning. Thankfully, applying some fundamentals will provide faster more accurate measurements.
In this case we plug-in 100 miles for the distance and 100 miles per hour for the velocity and we calculate 1.0 hours as the time for the object to travel the distance. What is the certainty we have in our estimate? In the above problem, both the distance and the velocity were exactly known so the accuracy of our estimate is 100%. The error is zero.
This is really not an estimate, but more of a calculation. Estimate generally involve some approximations. However, from this simple problem we can already see some fundamentals of estimation that we will use. The relationship between time, velocity and distance will be useful.
In addition to this form we have a number of other panels that present the data in a specialized way. For example we could have a panel that presents the names of all registered users. Another panel could present data about only the most recent users. While another displays a list of unique lucky numbers. Yet another presents color swatches of all the favorite colors. The development of these panels could be quite complex. Each will probably have its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
